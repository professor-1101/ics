THEME SCREENSHOT INSTRUCTIONS
===============================================

WordPress themes should include a screenshot.png file in the
theme root directory to show a preview in WordPress admin.

SPECIFICATIONS:
- Filename: screenshot.png
- Size: 1200 x 900 pixels
- Format: PNG
- Location: /wp-content/themes/ics-group/screenshot.png

HOW TO CREATE:
1. Open your WordPress site homepage in a browser
2. Take a screenshot of the full page
3. Crop to 1200x900 pixels (4:3 ratio)
4. Save as screenshot.png
5. Upload to the theme directory

OR USE A SCREENSHOT TOOL:
- Mac: Cmd+Shift+4 (then crop in Preview)
- Windows: Snipping Tool or Snip & Sketch
- Online: Use https://www.browserstack.com/screenshots

ALTERNATIVE:
You can also screenshot the "What We Do" page or
Resources page - any page that shows the theme design well.

The theme will work without a screenshot, but it's
recommended for better admin UX.

Current Status: ⚠️  No screenshot.png present
Installation: ✅ Theme installs fine without it
